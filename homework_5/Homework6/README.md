### General Description: 

I created a modular function which display each menu based on an array ( that s how i can simply display each menu option whitout overcrowding the code) also a implemented a modular function for navigation through the menu and ore more modular function for settings adjusmnets in which i can simply provide the function the current ammount and the maximum ammount  and it will render automatically a amenu in which i can select a new value in that range) 
I can say that all those optimisations simplyfied a lot the code and it made the code very easy to mantain the drowback of this approach is that it cossumes more memory to render all the menus because all of those menus are stored in global variables.

Components: LCD Screen, Matrix 8x8, cables , joystick , breadboard.

Only a part of the game ( the menu with options/ highscore / start / about / how to play )
