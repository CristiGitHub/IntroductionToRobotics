#Homework 1:
RGB Led <br/>
In this project i designed and coded an rgb led controlled by 3 pontentiometers <br/>
code optimisations:  <br/>
-> Low Pass Filter ( To reduce the flickering for values lower than a seted integer)  <br/>
-> Voltage Stabilizer ( To reduce the noise caused by the poor wiring :D ) <br/>
-> Load Last Preset Function <br/>
