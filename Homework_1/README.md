#Homework 1:
RGB Led
In this project i designed and coded an rgb led controlled by 3 pontentiometers
code optimisations:
-> Low Pass Filter ( To reduce the flickering for values lower than a seted integer)
-> Voltage Stabilizer ( To reduce the noise caused by the poor wiring :D )
-> Load Last Preset Function
